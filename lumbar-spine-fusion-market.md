<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lumbar Spine Fusion Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional</li><li>Minimally Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lumbar spine fusion market is divided into two primary types: traditional and minimally invasive approaches. Traditional lumbar spine fusion involves larger incisions and more extensive muscle dissection, leading to a longer recovery time but often providing greater direct visualization of the surgical field. Conversely, minimally invasive lumbar spine fusion utilizes smaller incisions and advanced techniques to reduce tissue damage and promote quicker recovery. This method often results in less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stays, appealing to both patients and healthcare providers.</p></p>
