<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Remolding Orthoses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial Remolding Orthoses (CROs) are specialized devices designed to correct positional skull deformities in infants. The market comprises two primary types: active helmets and passive helmets. Active helmets utilize adjustable padding to apply consistent pressure on specific areas of the skull, promoting reshaping as the child's head grows. Conversely, passive helmets are rigid and maintain the head in a corrected posture without adjustment. Both types aim to provide effective treatment for conditions like plagiocephaly, ensuring optimal head shape development.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Cranial Remolding Orthoses Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plagiocephaly</li><li>Brachycephaly</li><li>Scaphocephaly</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial remolding orthoses market addresses conditions such as plagiocephaly, brachycephaly, and scaphocephaly, which involve atypical head shapes in infants. Plagiocephaly, characterized by flattening on one side, is commonly caused by prolonged positioning. Brachycephaly, marked by a wide and short appearance, often results from lying flat on the back. Scaphocephaly, distinguished by an elongated head shape, can arise from early fusion of skull bones. These orthoses promote natural head shape development and improve aesthetics, enhancing overall infant health and well-being.</p></p>
