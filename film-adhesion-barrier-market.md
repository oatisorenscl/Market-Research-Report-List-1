<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Film Adhesion Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The film adhesion barrier market is segmented into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable barriers are designed to be gradually dissolved and absorbed by the body, promoting healing while minimizing long-term foreign material presence. Non-absorbable barriers, on the other hand, remain intact in the body, providing ongoing protection against adhesions but requiring eventual surgical removal. Both types serve to prevent the formation of adhesions after surgery, enhancing patient recovery and outcomes.</p></p>
