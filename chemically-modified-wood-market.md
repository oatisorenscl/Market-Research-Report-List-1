<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemically Modified Wood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acetylated Wood</li><li>Furfurylized wood</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chemically modified wood market primarily includes acetylated wood and furfurylized wood. Acetylated wood undergoes a treatment process that enhances its resistance to moisture, decay, and insects by replacing hydroxyl groups with acetyl groups, resulting in enhanced durability. Furfurylized wood is treated with furfuryl alcohol, which penetrates and polymerizes within the wood structure, improving its dimensional stability and resistance to environmental factors. Both types offer sustainable alternatives to traditional wood, appealing to eco-conscious consumers and industries seeking durable materials.</p></p>
